<h1>3D Ascii Rendering In Python (Using Pygame)</h1>
A lightweight pygame engine, using pygame, to simulate a spinning in ascii characters.<br>
Learn about rotation matrices, 3D rendering, lumination and much more!
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3D Projection: Simulates 3D rendering using 2D transformations.</li>
  <li>Customizable: Easily tweak the cube's size, speed, and colors.</li>
  <li>Real-Time Rotation: The cube spins around its axes.</li>
  <li>Lighting Effects: Includes natural lighting simulation with dot products and plane vectors.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Repository Structure</h2>
Donut/<br>
<ul>
  <li>cube.py: Main script, spinning cube</li>
  <li>donut.py: Side script, spinning Donut, used as reference</li>
  <li>README.md: project overview</li>
</ul>


<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup</h2>
<b>1. Clone The Repository</b>

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Staf707/Donut.git
cd Donut
```
<b>2. Install Dependencies Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install Pygame:</b>
```cmd
pip install pygame
```
<b>3. Run The script</b>
```cmd
python cube.py
```

<h2>üìñ How It Works</h2>
<h3>1. 3D to 2D projection</h3>
The cube's vertices are transformed and projected onto a 2D screen using the following:
<ul>
  <li>Rotation Matrices: Rotate the cube around its X, Y, and Z axes.</li>
  <li>Perspective Projection: Maps 3D coordinates into 2D space.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Shading and Lighting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Natural lighting is simulated using vector dot products to determine luminance.</li>
  <li>ASCII characters (" .,-~:;=!*#$@") are used to represent varying levels of brightness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Pixel Grid Rendering</h3>
<ul><li>The display is divided into a grid, and ASCII characters are drawn on each pixel based on the cube's projection.</li></ul>


<h2>üéÆ Controls</h2>
<ul><li>Pause/Resume Rotation: Press any key to toggle the rotation of the cube.</li></ul>

<h2>üßë‚Äçüíª Customization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lighting: Toggle natural lighting with the natural_light variable in the script.</li>
  <li>Color Mode: Set colour = False for a white cube or True for dynamic colors.</li>
  <li>Cube Size and Rotation: Modify the cube's dimensions and rotation speeds in the while running loop.</li>
</ul>
